    "\n",
    "1. load `train.csv` and do some exploration (the number of columns is relevant, avoid using `pairplots`, it would be very slow and undreadable)\n",
    "2. cancel useless columns, if any, use as target the `target` column, separate predicting from target into `X_full` and `y`\n",
    "3. Try unsupervised attribute selection: use `PCA` to keep only the transformed features able to explain, cumulatively, 90% of the total variance\n",
    "4. store in X the remaining, transformed variables\n",
    "5. split the X and y data into __train__ and __test__; since the file is quite large, for a faster development use not more than 2000 rows for training, and the remaining for testing\n",
    "6. show two pie charts of the distribution of classes into `y_train` and `y_test` to verify if they are similar\n",
    "7. optimize with `GridSearchCV` DecistionTree and RandomForest, using two different targets: `accuracy` and `f1_macro`\n",
    "8. show the confusion matrices of the best model for `accuracy` and `f1_macro` and comment the differences\n",
    "9. For the final test, upload the file `test.csv`, apply the same data reduction applied to `train.csv`,\n",
    "10. make the prediction using the models previously optimized\n",
    "11. show the confusion matrices and comment the comparison with the ones previously generated"
